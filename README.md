#Caesar Cipher

This is a first project [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) Ruby track. See [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/building-blocks) for more information.

A command line Caesar Cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string. A test suite is also included with a [later project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/testing-ruby) in the Ruby Track to test the program with RSpec.
